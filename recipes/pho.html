        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This comforting Vietnamese noodle soup is a soul-warming hug in a bowl, bursting with fragrant broth, tender meat, and fresh herbs. Imagine delicate rice noodles swirling in a flavorful beef or chicken broth, topped with melt-in-your-mouth slices of meat, fragrant with star anise and cloves. A sprinkle of fresh herbs like Thai basil and cilantro adds a
             final layer of vibrant freshness, making each sip an aromatic delight.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound dried rice noodles (like Banh Pho)</li>
            <li>1/2 pound thinly sliced beef (flank steak, brisket, or tri-tip)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped Thai basil</li>
            <li>Lime wedges</li>
            <li>Sriracha, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the broth: Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the beef bones and ground beef on a baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, until browned.</li>
            <li>Transfer the roasted bones and beef to a large pot. Add the charred onion and ginger, star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, fish sauce, sugar, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 3 hours, or up to 6 hours for a richer flavor.</li>
            <li>Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot. Discard the solids.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles: Soak the rice noodles in warm water for 10-15 minutes, until softened. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the beef: Thinly slice the raw beef against the grain.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Pho: Divide the noodles among bowls. Add hot broth to each bowl. Briefly dunk the raw beef slices in the hot broth just until they cook through (optional: you can also cook the beef in a separate pan and add it to the bowls).</li>
            <li>Top with green onions, cilantro, Thai basil, and lime wedges. Serve with Sriracha if desired.</li>
        </ol>
